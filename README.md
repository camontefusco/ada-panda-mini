## üöÄ Executive Summary

- **Problem:** Standard ADA assays underestimate immunogenicity at therapeutic drug levels due to drug interference.  
- **Solution:** This repo simulates **PandA (PEG + Acid) correction**, showing how it restores ADA detection, improves drug tolerance, and reduces assay bias.  
- **Impact:** Demonstrates how **bioanalytical method choice** affects PK, exposure‚Äìresponse, and dose justification, with outputs formatted for **regulatory reports** and **digital health standards**.

## üî¨ Purpose

Therapeutic drug in serum can **mask anti-drug antibodies (ADA)** in bridging immunoassays, causing **false negatives** and **underestimation of immunogenicity**.  
The **PandA method** (*PEG precipitation + Acid dissociation*) was developed to overcome this interference and achieve **high drug tolerance** in ADA detection.

This repo provides a **minimal, reproducible simulation** of:

- How **drug interference** biases ADA recovery in a standard assay  
- How **PandA-style correction** restores ADA detection  
- How this difference propagates to **PK exposure, target attainment, and dose recommendations**  
- How results align with **literature benchmarks** and **regulatory expectations**

- **Sanofi EBF 2024**: Practical defaults: **6% PEG precip**, **3% PEG wash**, **acetic acid 300 mM (pH 2.5‚Äì3.5, ~30‚Äì45 min)**; caution that ‚â•60 min acid can reduce ADA signal. [PDF](https://e-b-f.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/D1-44.-Brendy-Van-Butsel-Ortwin-Vande-Vyver-sanofi.pdf)

## üß™ Method overview

**PandA critical steps:**
1. **Complex formation**: Saturate ADA with drug to capture all ADA.  
2. **PEG precipitation**: 6% PEG (cold), pellet complexes, wash √ó2 with 3% PEG.  
3. **Acid dissociation & coating**: Acetic acid 300‚Äì500 mM (pH 2.5‚Äì3.5), 30‚Äì45 min, coat directly on high-bind plates under acidic conditions.  
4. **Detection**: Specific anti-Ig detection (e.g. ECL), blockers & buffers tuned to reduce background.

**Trade-offs:**  
- Too harsh acid or long incubation (‚â•60 min) can damage ADA ‚Üí reduce dynamic range.  
- Method chosen based on **required drug tolerance**: bridging OK up to low ¬µg/mL; PandA for ‚â•100s ¬µg/mL to mg/mL.

## üñºÔ∏è PandA Workflow (schematic)

![PandA workflow](./docs/panda_workflow.png)

*PandA improves ADA drug tolerance by precipitating complexes (PEG), 
acid-dissociating them under controlled pH, and detecting freed ADA with 
specific anti-Ig reagents. Default parameters shown are industry-reported 
(Sanofi, 2024).*

## üõ†Ô∏è Method parameters (defaults)

These reflect Sanofi‚Äôs EBF 2024 ‚Äúdefault PandA,‚Äù safe for most programs:

```yaml
PEG_precip: 6% (cold)
PEG_wash: 3% (√ó2)
Acid: Acetic acid 300 mM, pH 2.8‚Äì3.2
Acid_time: 30‚Äì45 min
```
## Tuning guide (beginner-friendly):
- Need higher tolerance (>mg/mL drug): consider Glycine-HCl (10‚Äì50 mM, pH 2.5‚Äì3.0).
- Low recovery: adjust PEG % (5‚Äì7%), shorten acid incubation, test alternative acids.
- Signal loss/dynamic range shrinkage: avoid acid ‚â•60 min, reduce acid strength, check for ADA denaturation.
- High background: optimize molar excess of labeled reagents, blockers, wash rigor.

## üßæ Validation metrics (aligned to FDA 2019)
- Sensitivity: lowest ADA concentration reliably detected (LLOQ).
- Drug tolerance: max drug concentration where recovery ‚â•80%.
- Target interference: confirm assay still detects ADA in presence of target antigen.
- Specificity: confirmatory inhibition with drug.
- Precision: intra-/inter-assay CVs for NC/LPC/HPC.
- Cut-points: Screening (SCP) & Confirmatory (CCP) derived from NCs.

## üìà Results

### 1. Drug-tolerance curves
![Drug tolerance curve](reports/figures/01_drug_tolerance_curve.png)

**Interpretation:**  
- The **standard bridging assay** shows a sharp drop in ADA recovery above ~10 ¬µg/mL drug, consistent with drug masking and loss of sensitivity.  
- The **PandA-corrected assay** maintains recovery ‚â•80% up to ~100‚Äì500 ¬µg/mL drug, in line with literature reports (Zoghbi 2015; Sanofi EBF 2024).  
- **Regulatory meaning:** drug tolerance must be validated; bridging alone would fail to meet tolerance requirements for therapeutic exposures.

---

### 2. ADA time series (True vs Measured vs PandA)
![ADA time series](reports/figures/02_ada_time_series.png)

**Interpretation:**  
- **True ADA** rises steadily after dosing.  
- **Measured (uncorrected)** underestimates ADA during periods of high drug concentration, masking immunogenicity.  
- **PandA-corrected** closely tracks the true ADA profile.  
- **Regulatory meaning:** Without correction, trial reports would understate ADA incidence, misinforming risk assessment.

---

### 3. Measurement bias vs drug concentration
![Bias by drug bin](reports/figures/03_bias_by_drug_bin.png)

**Interpretation:**  
- **Bias** in standard assay grows increasingly negative as drug increases, reflecting systematic under-recovery.  
- **PandA correction** yields near-zero bias across drug bins.  
- **Regulatory meaning:** FDA guidance requires demonstration of bias control; PandA provides evidence of acceptable accuracy.

---

### 4. Impact on PK target attainment
![Target attainment impact](reports/figures/04_target_attainment.png)

**Interpretation:**  
- **Uncorrected assay** overestimates the proportion of patients achieving exposure targets.  
- **PandA-corrected data** reveals fewer patients above threshold, especially ADA-positive subjects.  
- **Regulatory meaning:** Bioanalytical method choice directly influences dose recommendations and labeling.

---

### 5. PASS/ALERT heatmap
![PASS ALERT heatmap](reports/figures/05_pass_alert_heatmap.png)

**Interpretation:**  
- **Standard assay** triggers ALERT at drug levels ‚â•10 ¬µg/mL, failing the ‚â•80% recovery benchmark.  
- **PandA** yields PASS up to high ¬µg/mL‚Äìmg/mL ranges.  
- **Regulatory meaning:** clear visual justification for method selection in validation reports.

---

## üßæ Summary

- **Assay artifact:** Standard bridging ADA assays underestimate ADA at therapeutic drug levels.  
- **Solution:** PandA improves drug tolerance, maintains recovery, and reduces bias.  
- **Downstream impact:** Corrected ADA profiles reveal true clearance increases and lower target attainment in ADA-positive patients.  
- **Clinical pharmacology relevance:** Bioanalytical method choice feeds directly into PK/PD, exposure‚Äìresponse, and ultimately **dose selection**.  
- **Regulatory alignment:** This simulation reflects expectations from FDA/EMA to validate drug tolerance and document method selection.
